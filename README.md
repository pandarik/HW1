Crowdfunding Assignment
Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have experienced significant growth and popularity since the late 2000s. These platforms provide a space for a diverse range of individuals, from independent creators to well-known celebrities, to seek funding for their innovative projects. However, not every project achieves success.

To secure funding, a project must either meet or surpass its initial funding goal. Consequently, many organizations invest substantial resources in examining past projects, hoping to uncover the elusive ‚Äúsecret‚Äù to achieving success. In this week‚Äôs Challenge, you will delve into a database of 1,000 sample projects, aiming to reveal any hidden trends that could shed light on the keys to crowdfunding triumph. üöÄüåü

Objective
The goal of this assignment is to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into what factors contribute to a successful crowdfunding campaign. By analyzing project attributes such as funding goals, categories, and campaign duration, we aim to provide recommendations for future project creators.

Dataset
The dataset contains information on 1,000 crowdfunding projects, including details such as project name, funding goal, campaign duration, category, and outcome (successful or not). We will use Python and data analysis techniques to extract meaningful information from this dataset.

Tasks
Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand its distribution, correlations, and trends.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that may impact project success.
Modeling: Build predictive models to determine factors that contribute to a successful campaign.
Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for project creators based on the analysis.
Deliverables
Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.
README summarizing the analysis, findings, and recommendations.
